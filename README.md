# EDI in Maths Support â€“ Cardiff University

Welcome to the official repository for the **Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI)** research project conducted in collaboration with the **School of Mathematics at Cardiff University**. This project investigates how EDI is reflected within the *Maths Support* services, with a focus on identifying gaps and proposing data-driven improvements.

---

## Project Overview

This study aims to evaluate **EDI** in the *Maths Support* service by:

* Analyzing participation data across **gender**, **age**, and **ethnic backgrounds**.
* Highlighting underrepresented groups.
* Proposing actionable insights to improve inclusivity and accessibility.

While existing literature discusses Maths support in broad terms, **no current research directly addresses EDI in this context** â€” making this study a unique and timely contribution.

---

## Methodology

We used a **mixed-methods approach**:

* **Descriptive Analysis**: To understand distribution patterns across demographic variables.
* **Inferential Statistics**: To compare outcomes and reveal hidden inequalities.
* **Comparative Metrics**: To assess changes over time and track service impact.

---

## Key Findings

* Participation by **ethnic minorities and non-male genders** is noticeably lower.
* **Incomplete registration data** (missing gender, nationality, etc.) limits actionable analysis.
* A clear opportunity exists to introduce better **data collection at onboarding**.

---

## Recommendations

To enhance inclusivity and improve data quality:

1. **Mandatory demographic fields** at registration (e.g., gender, country, academic status).
2. **Post-support feedback forms** to track learning improvement.
3. **EDI dashboard metrics** for continuous monitoring and evaluation.
4. **Awareness campaigns** to destigmatize Maths Support usage and boost engagement.
5. **Voluntary participation incentives** to gather richer, more representative data.

## Impact & Future Scope

This research demonstrates that **local, targeted interventions** can lead to broader systemic improvements in inclusion. Although data limitations exist, the project provides a **scalable framework** for other academic services.

Future extensions could include:

* Collecting **country- or region-specific** participation trends.
* Integrating **longitudinal feedback** to track impact over academic years.
* Applying similar methods to **biosciences, engineering**, or **interdisciplinary support units**.
